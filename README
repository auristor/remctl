1. Building

  # autoconf
  # autoheader
  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install

You'll probably have to specify some options to configure. By default
things gets installed using the prefix /usr/local.  For example,
/usr/local/sbin, /usr/local/bin, etc.

To change the prefix use the --prefix option:

  # ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

To compile with static libraries (recommended - fewer runtime dependencies):
 
  # ./configure --enable-static

If your kerberos libraries and includes aren't in /usr/local/include and
/usr/local/lib (or some other include directory and library directory
searched by default by your compiler), then you need to also specify
--with-kerberos=path:

  # ../configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-kerberos=/usr/pubsw


2. Usage information is described in the man pages included with this 
distribution. Design document is also available <insert URL>


3. Porting

remctl should port reasonably well. It has been tested on:

Solaris 8
Linux (glibc 2.2)
AIX 4.3
