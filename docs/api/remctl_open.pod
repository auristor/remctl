=head1 NAME

remctl_open - Connect to a remote remctl server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <remctl.h>

int B<remctl_open>(struct remctl *I<r>, const char *I<host>,
                   unsigned short I<port>,
                   const char *I<principal>);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

remctl_open() opens a TCP connection to the given I<host> on the given
I<port> and then authenticates using the remctl protocol and the service
principal I<principal>.  I<r> is a remctl struct created via remctl_new().
I<host> must not be NULL.  If I<port> is 0, the library first attempts to
connect to the registered port of 4373 and then tries the legacy port of
4444 if that fails.  Future versions of the library will drop this
fallback to 4444.  If I<principal> is NULL, a service principal of
C<host/I<host>> in the default local realm is used.

The remctl protocol uses Kerberos v5 via GSS-API for authentication.  The
underlying GSS-API library will use the default ticket cache for
authentication, so to successfully use remctl_open(), the caller should
already have Kerberos tickets for an appropriate realm stored in its
default ticket cache.  The environment variable KRB5CCNAME can be used to
control which ticket cache is used.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

remctl_open() returns true on success and false on failure.  On failure,
the caller should call remctl_error() to retrieve the error message.

=head1 CAVEATS

The default behavior, when a port of 0 is given, of trying 4373 and
falling back to 4444 will be removed in a future version of this library
in favor of using the C<remctl> service in F</etc/services> if set and
then falling back on only 4373.  4444 was the poorly-chosen original
remctl port and should be phased out.

=head1 NOTES

The remctl port number, 4373, was derived by tracing the diagonals of a
QWERTY keyboard up from the letters C<remc> to the number row.
