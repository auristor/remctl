=head1 NAME

remctl_open - Connect to a remote remctl server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <remctl.h>

int
remctl_open(struct remctl *I<r>, const char *I<host>, unsigned short I<port>,
            const char *I<principal>);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

remctl_open() opens a TCP connection to the given I<host> on the given
I<port> and then authenticates using the remctl protocol and the service
principal I<principal>.  I<r> is a remctl struct created via remctl_new().
I<host> must not be NULL.  If I<port> is 0, the default port of 4444 is
used.  If I<principal> is NULL, a service principal of C<host/I<host>> in
the default local realm is used.

The remctl protocol uses Kerberos v5 via GSS-API for authentication.  The
underlying GSS-API library will use the default ticket cache for
authentication, so to successfully use remctl_open(), the caller should
already have Kerberos tickets for an appropriate realm stored in its
default ticket cache.  The environment variable KRB5CCNAME can be used to
control which ticket cache is used.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

remctl_open() returns true on success and false on failure.  On failure,
the caller should call remctl_error() to retrieve the error message.
