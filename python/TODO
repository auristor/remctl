- Testing. The high-level interface may need some
  tweaking to make it make more sense. 

- Make sure exceptions are set in all error cases in _remctl.

- Return a memory exception when remctl_new fails.

- Optional arguments to py_remctl_open.

- RemctlArgError should be TypeError or ValueError.

- RemctlNotOpened should be RemctlNotOpenedError.

- Fix default arguments for the remctl() function.

- Can have just one command argument.

- Fix default arguments to open().  host should be required.  Make the
  corresponding changes to the underlying _remctl module.

- Don't store host, port, and principal in the object; there's no need
  and it means adding self.* in front of everything.  Likewise for the
  commlist.
