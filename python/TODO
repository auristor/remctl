- Testing. The high-level interface may need some
  tweaking to make it make more sense. 

- Make sure exceptions are set in all error cases in _remctl.

- Return a memory exception when remctl_new fails.

- RemctlArgError should be TypeError or ValueError.

- RemctlNotOpened should be RemctlNotOpenedError.

- Don't store host, port, and principal in the object; there's no need
  and it means adding self.* in front of everything.  Likewise for the
  commlist.
