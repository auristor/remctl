                       User-Visible remctl Changes

remctl 1.3 (2003-07-21)

    Exit with non-zero status if the remote command failed rather than
    always exiting with zero status if the network exchange worked
    successfully.

    Adjust logging priorities and include some additional information in
    the log of the command.

    Improved the README and added a make dist target to the makefile.

remctl 1.2 (2003-04-04)

    Read from both standard out and standard error of the spawned command
    in turn to better prevent deadlock.

    Set the REMUSER environment variable to the remote authenticated user
    (and continue setting SCPRINCIPAL as well for backward compatibility).

remctl 1.1 (2003-02-28)

    Add an snprintf implementation for systems that don't have it and use
    it for log messages.

    Additional fleshing out of the Java client.

    Lots of code cleanup and style fixes.

remctl 1.0 (2002-11-22)

    Initial release.
