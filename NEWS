                       User-Visible remctl Changes

remctl 1.8 (2005-05-04)

    Support include <file> in the configuration file.  Also support
    including a directory, which includes every file in that directory
    that doesn't have a period in the name.

    Support continuation lines (using backslash) in the configuration
    file, and clean up the parser to be more flexible about whitespace on
    otherwise empty lines or comment lines.

    Change the default remctl.conf location to be relative to sysconfdir
    (<prefix>/etc by default) instead of the current directory.

    Improve the remctld man page, documenting all of the supported options
    including stand-alone mode.

remctl 1.7 (2005-02-22)

    Close extra file descriptors before spawning a child process in
    remctl.  The only file descriptors open should be standard output and
    standard error.  This will fix problems with using remctld to start
    long-running daemons; before, remctld would never realize that the
    child process had exited.

    Use select to wait for child output in remctld rather than
    busy-waiting so as not to burn CPU cycles when the child takes a while
    to produce output.

    Document the -p option for the client.

remctl 1.6 (2004-05-18)

    Fix format string vulnerabilities when logging the remote command.

remctl 1.5 (2004-03-04)

    Fix a bug in remctld where it would segfault when trying to check the
    ACLs for a command not present in the configuration file.

    Portability fix to return the exit status of the command in network
    byte order.

remctl 1.4 (2003-11-12)

    Add support for a logmask=n option in the configuration file that
    masks those arguments in the logging output (used when some of the
    options for that command contain private information).

    Add optimizations in the GSS code to do fewer network writes.

    Significant improvements to the Java client.

    Some minor cleanups to logging, installation, and the configure
    script.

remctl 1.3 (2003-07-21)

    Exit with non-zero status if the remote command failed rather than
    always exiting with zero status if the network exchange worked
    successfully.

    Adjust logging priorities and include some additional information in
    the log of the command.

    Improved the README and added a make dist target to the makefile.

remctl 1.2 (2003-04-04)

    Read from both standard out and standard error of the spawned command
    in turn to better prevent deadlock.

    Set the REMUSER environment variable to the remote authenticated user
    (and continue setting SCPRINCIPAL as well for backward compatibility).

remctl 1.1 (2003-02-28)

    Add an snprintf implementation for systems that don't have it and use
    it for log messages.

    Additional fleshing out of the Java client.

    Lots of code cleanup and style fixes.

remctl 1.0 (2002-11-22)

    Initial release.
