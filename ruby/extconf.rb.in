# We add $CFLAGS to the contents of $CPPFLAGS since otherwise we lose the
# Ruby $CFLAGS.  The build system overrides CFLAGS with make warnings.
# This is really a bug in Ruby; CFLAGS is a user variable that the user
# should be able to set at build time without losing information.
$INCFLAGS = "-I@abs_top_srcdir@ #{$INCFLAGS}"
$CPPFLAGS << " #{$CFLAGS} @CPPFLAGS@"
$LDFLAGS  = "-L@abs_top_srcdir@/client/.libs -lremctl @LDFLAGS@ #{$LDFLAGS}"

# Intentionally do not check for libremctl here.  We're forcing the link
# with LDFLAGS above, and mkmf is apparently too stupid to use $LDFLAGS
# when searching for a shared library and fails unless libremctl is
# already installed in the system locations.
