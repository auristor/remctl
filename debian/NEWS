remctl (2.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  remctl now has an IANA-assigned port number (4373).  The inetd.conf
  entry for remctl-server will not be changed if an entry already exists,
  but you may want to change port 4444 to 4373 once all your clients have
  been upgraded.

  The remctl client (command-line or library) will attempt to connect to
  4373 by default and fall back to 4444 if that fails, but if port-4373
  connections are dropped by a firewall, they may take some time to time
  out.  You may override this behavior and specify a specific port with -p
  for the command-line client and with the port argument in the library
  API.
