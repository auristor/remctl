Description: remote Kerberos-authenticated command execution
 remctl consists of a client and server for executing specific commands on
 a remote system with Kerberos authentication.  The allowable commands
 must be listed in a server configuration file, and the executable run on
 the server may be mapped to any command name.  Each command is also
 associated with an ACL containing a list of Kerberos principals
 authorized to run that command.
 .
 Included in this package is both the client (remctl) and the server
 (remctld).  The server will not be started automatically.
