remctl (3.2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - If remctld receives a help command with no arguments and no help
      command is explicitly defined, it will look for commands to which
      the current user has access and for which the summary option is set
      and run them with the argument given by the summary option,
      collecting the output and sending it back to the client.
    - If remctld receives a help command with one or two arguments and a
      command entry exists matching those arguments, the user has access
      to run it, and the help option is set, the command is run with the
      help option as the subcommand.
    - Always close the server's connection to the client on low-level
      network and GSS-API errors.
    - Fix remctld segfault when the configuration does not define any
      commands.
  * Update Ruby extension packaging for the new Ruby standard.  The
    ruby-remctl package replaces all libremctl-ruby* packages, which are
    now transitional packages to ease the upgrade.  The Ruby extension is
    now installed in the vendor_ruby directory and the modules for all
    supported Ruby versions are included in the same package.
  * Switch to xz compression for the upstream and Debian tarballs.
  * Move single-debian-patch to local-options and patch-header to
    local-patch-header so that they only apply to the packages I build and
    NMUs get regular version-numbered patches.
  * Enable parallel builds.
  * Mark libremctl-dev Multi-Arch: same and remctl-client and
    remctl-server Multi-Arch: foreign.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.3 (no changes required).

remctl (3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New remctl_set_timeout function and corresponding API in all the
      language bindings to set a timeout on all further network operations
      on that client connection.
    - remctld supports a user configuration option to run a program as a
      specific user (with supplemental groups).
    - remctld's timeout is now one hour between messages instead of a
      total limit of one hour for the connection.
    - PHP's remctl_output no longer warns on failure.
    - Python's _remctl.remctl_output returns an empty tuple on error.
    - Fix error reporting for non-blocking connect.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Feb 2012 13:14:14 -0800

remctl (3.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch the upstream build system to provide more hooks for Perl and
    Python builds and make use of them, removing all the complexity in
    debian/rules to selectively rebuild parts of the source.  As a side
    effect, fix application of the hardening flags to all of the
    interpretor modules.
  * Use dh-autoreconf to rebuild the Autotools build system, and link with
    --as-needed to remove the additional unnecessarily library
    dependencies for the client.  Remove the workaround of relinking the
    binary, which removed the hardening flags.
  * Pass the hardening flags into the Perl and Python module rebuilds.
  * Depend on debhelper (>= 9) now that V9 is no longer experimental and
    remove now-unneeded Lintian override.
  * Remove the special additional test run for kfreebsd-amd64.  The
    problem has been located and corrected upstream.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 04 Feb 2012 20:21:09 -0800

remctl (3.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the skip count for the network utility test suite, fixing a
    spurious test failure on systems without IPv6.  Patch from Felix
    Geyer.  (Closes: #654982)
  * Fix removal of build directory paths from RPATH when building the Perl
    module inside a build directory that contains regex metacharacters.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 08 Jan 2012 21:01:28 -0800

remctl (3.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable the network timeout test for right now since kfreebsd-amd64 is
    still failing.  Add some additional debugging and run the test with
    full output for now so that this test can hopefully be reinstated in a
    later version.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Nov 2011 19:21:14 -0700

remctl (3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Further test suite fixes for kfreebsd: Skip network timeout tests if a
    short listen queue doesn't cause any connections to fail, and fix the
    bounds handling when closing open sockets if all connections
    succeeded.  (Closes: #647254)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Nov 2011 12:47:06 -0700

remctl (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow for different networking behavior seen on kfreebsd systems in
    the test suite.  (Closes: #647254)
    - FreeBSD kernel refuses connections after listen queue exhaustion.
    - getaddrinfo may return other errors on invalid host lookups.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 01 Nov 2011 21:07:03 -0700

  * New upstream release.
    - New protocol version 3, adding a NOOP command.
    - More consistent and formal handling of continuation commands.
    - The server no longer closes the connection after version or error
      replies.
    - Add new remctl_set_source_ip function to set the source IP address
      for outgoing client connections.
    - Add new -b option to remctl command-line client to set source IP.
    - Add new remctl_set_ccache function to specify the credential store
      to use for GSS-API authentication.

remctl (2.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip the getaddrinfo invalid host test if foo.invalid resolves using
    gethostbyname.  This hopefully works around build issues on kFreeBSD.
    (See #626047)
  * Update network utility library from rra-c-util 3.4 to fix problems
    with the test suite on hosts that bind IPv4 addresses when binding
    IPv6 addresses by default.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 10 May 2011 20:53:25 -0700

remctl (2.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Add Ruby bindings (install libremctl-ruby).
    - Add support for PCRE and regex ACLs in the remctl server.
    - remctld now sets REMCTL_COMMAND to the command run.
  * Use dh_gencontrol -- -V to pass the PHP version substvar instead of
    writing it to the substvars file.
  * Switch to 3.0 (quilt) source format.  Force a single Debian patch and
    include a custom patch header explaining that it is a rollup of any
    fixes cherry-picked from upstream and breaking those patches out
    separately would be work for no gain.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 02 May 2010 18:13:50 -0700

remctl (2.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make use of the new Makefile variables in the upstream 2.15 release to
    control the Python installation and test suite.  Hopefully fixes
    installation with Python 2.6 as the default.  (Closes: #571509)
  * Fix the PHP tests to work properly with PHP 5.3, which no longer
    passes environment variables through to the running test programs.
  * Downgrade the libremctl-dev dependency on libkrb5-dev to suggests
    since it's only required for static linking.
  * Fix a spelling error in the Net::Remctl man page.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.4 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Feb 2010 18:06:48 -0800

remctl (2.15-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not add php5 as an alternative to the phpapi dependency in
    php5-remctl, fixing problems with the upcoming PHP 5.3 transition.
    Thanks, Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #566300)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Jan 2010 11:21:37 -0800

remctl (2.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  * Fix debian/rules logic for forcing Python module tests to be run using
    the default version of Python.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Nov 2009 18:51:38 -0800

remctl (2.14-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add --install-layout=deb to the Python setup.py install commands to
    support Python 2.6.
  * Add php5-cli to the build dependencies so that the test suite is run.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V7.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization with overrides.
    - Skip the test suite if nocheck is set in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
    - Let dh_install handle installation of remctl.conf.
    - Add ${misc:Depends} to all dependencies.
  * Apply a build-time fix to the upstream Makefile to only use the Python
    build directory for the default version of Python.  This is required
    now that make check is run after building Python modules for all
    supported versions.
  * Use the right optimization and warning flags when relinking libremctl.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Aug 2009 19:28:16 -0700

remctl (2.14-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stop including the protocol documentation in remctl-server.  Add a
    pointer to the remctl-client package for protocol documentation in
    remctl-server's README.Debian.
  * Add a doc-base registration file for the remctl protocol specification
    in remctl-client.
  * Do not install the libremctl.la file.  Libtool *.la files force other
    packages using Libtool to declare excessive library dependencies.
  * Add an explicit build-dependency on Perl.  It was being pulled in by
    other build dependencies, but this is more correct.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.3 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Aug 2009 16:12:57 -0700

remctl (2.14-2) unstable; urgency=low

    - Arguments passed on standard input may now contain nuls.
    - remctld logging now replaces unprintable characters.
    - "command" and "subcommand" are now used instead of "type" and
      "service" in all documentation of remctl commands.
    - Better diagnosis of nul characters in command arguments.
    - Plug several memory leaks in the remctld server.
  * Allow php5 as an alternative for the phpapi dependency to avoid a
    Lintian warning (although I'm not sure this change is correct and need
    to investigate further later).
  * Update standards version to 3.8.1 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 22 May 2009 16:20:45 -0700

      files, limit the files included to characters in [a-zA-Z0-9_-] to
      avoid editor temporary files.  (Closes: #479481)
  * On new installations of remctl-server, add the inetd.conf line with
    the symbolic protocol name rather than the port number.  Depend on a
    new enough version of netbase.  Remove that line in prerm.
  * Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.0 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Nov 2008 18:27:14 -0800

remctl (2.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move tcpd to Recommends for remctld.  It's used by the default
    inetd.conf line but isn't strictly required.
  * Stop including the Java client as an example; it's no longer just a
    few files.  Refer the curious to the source package in remctl-client's
    README.Debian.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Aug 2007 13:39:22 -0700

remctl (2.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix error handling bug when a client network connection fails.
    - Add C API man pages.
    - Fix several documentation errors in the Net::Remctl module.
  * Use DESTDIR in the install target in debian/rules rather than

    avoid a warning.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Jun 2007 18:07:25 -0700

remctl (2.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * remctl-server now depends on update-inetd directly and recommends
    openbsd-inetd | inet-superserver, since it will run without inetd but
    calls update-inetd in its postinst.
  * Remove the remctl transitional package now that etch is released.
  * Support reconfigure in the remctl-server postinst.

      file an error.
    - New protocol documentation.
  * Use a better way to optionally run make distclean.

remctl (1.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't assume "rule: export VARIABLE=value" works in debian/rules;
    instead, export the variable separate from the rule-specific setting.
    The make on at least one of the buildds didn't like this construct.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Jan 2006 23:25:59 -0800
