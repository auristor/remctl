  * New upstream version.
    - remctl stops parsing arguments at the first non-option to make it
      easier to pass options to remote programs.
    - Include example of how to use remctl like rsh.  Thanks, Romain
      LENGLET.

remctl (1.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - The -v verbose option is now -d (debug) for remctl and remctld.
    - Better and cleaner error reporting and logging.
    - Support linking with only the shared libraries called directly and
      relying on the shared libraries to pull in their own dependencies,
      reducing unnecessary package dependencies.
  * Build separate remctl-server and remctl-client packages (with a remctl
    transitional package for upgrades).
  * remctl-server now enables remctld by default.
  * Run remctld under tcpd and depend on tcpd.
  * Use a better method to optionally run make distclean.
  * Remove unused targets in debian/rules.
  * Use recommended indentation of Homepage link in long description.
  * Update copyright to my current format, remove the confusing clause
    about export that was removed from the upstream license, and add an
    explicit packaging copyright and license.
  * Update maintainer address.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.2 (no changes required).
