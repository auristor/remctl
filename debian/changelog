remctl (1.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't assume "rule: export VARIABLE=value" works in debian/rules;
    instead, export the variable separate from the rule-specific setting.
    The make on at least one of the buildds didn't like this construct.

remctl (1.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - The -v verbose option is now -d (debug) for remctl and remctld.

      relying on the shared libraries to pull in their own dependencies,
      reducing unnecessary package dependencies.

    transitional package for upgrades).
  * remctl-server now enables remctld by default.
  * Run remctld under tcpd and depend on tcpd.
  * Use a better method to optionally run make distclean.
  * Remove unused targets in debian/rules.
  * Use recommended indentation of Homepage link in long description.

    explicit packaging copyright and license.
  * Update maintainer address.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.2 (no changes required).
