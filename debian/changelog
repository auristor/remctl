remctl (2.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix server crash when client sends too many arguments.
    - Request sequence protection, don't require replay protection.
    - Standalone remctld removes PID file and handles signals.
    - Standalone remctld re-reads config on SIGHUP.
    - Standalone remctld doesn't exit after an hour.
    - libremctl now uses symbol versioning.
    - Allow port and principal to be omitted in Net::Remctl::open.
    - Documentation fixes for Net::Remctl.
    - Check for MIT GSS-API library first to avoid UMich libgssapi.
  * Allow inet-superserver to satisfy the update-inetd requirement.

    inetd.conf line but isn't strictly required.
  * Stop including the Java client as an example; it's no longer just a
    few files.  Refer the curious to the source package in remctl-client's
    README.Debian.

remctl (2.7-2) unstable; urgency=low
