remctl-client for Debian
------------------------

This package contains only the remctl command-line client.  For usage
information, see the man page.  For the remctld server, install the
remctl-server package.

A Java client is provided in /usr/share/remctl/examples/java.  It may not
work at your site without some tweaking.
